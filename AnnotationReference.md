# The Annotations #

## @com.googlecode.objectify.annotation.Entity ##
  * Required for all registered entity classes.
  * Optionally specifies the name of a kind, ie `@Entity(name="Person")`

## @com.googlecode.objectify.annotation.Id ##
  * Must be placed on one and only one field of an @Entity class
  * Field must be type `Long`, `long`, or `String`
  * If used on type `Long`, null values will be autogenerated on put()

## @com.googlecode.objectify.annotation.Parent ##
  * Placed on at most one field of type `Key`
  * Defines the entity group parent for an entity

## @com.googlecode.objectify.annotation.Subclass ##
  * Placed on subclasses of polymorphic types, both `@Entity` and embedded
  * Exclusive with `@Entity`
  * See [Polymorphism](http://code.google.com/p/objectify-appengine/wiki/Entities#Polymorphism).

## @com.googlecode.objectify.annotation.Index ##
  * Placed on a field or class.
  * When placed on a class, sets the default state for all fields of the class.
  * Can take `If` conditions which allow partial indexing.
  * @Index state is inherited by embedded classes and their fields, but can be overriden with @Unindex.
  * Indexed fields cost more space and cpu time to store, but can be queried on.
  * Translates to `Entity.setProperty()` at the low-level api.
  * Unless otherwise specified, all classes default to @Unindex.

## @com.googlecode.objectify.annotation.Unindex ##
  * Placed on a field or class.
  * When placed on a class, sets the default state for all fields of the class.
  * Can take `If` conditions which allow partial indexing.
  * @Unindex state is inherited by embedded classes and their fields, but can be overridden with @Index.
  * Unindexed fields consume less space and require less cpu time to store, but cannot be queried for.
  * Translates to `Entity.setUnindexedProperty()` at the low-level api.

## @com.googlecode.objectify.annotation.Ignore ##
  * Placed on any field
  * Makes the field opaque to storage in the datastore; the field will be ignored for both read and write.

## @com.googlecode.objectify.annotation.IgnoreSave ##
  * Placed on any field
  * Field will be loaded from the datastore but won't be saved
  * Can take `If` conditions which allow some values to be saved and not others.

## @com.googlecode.objectify.annotation.IgnoreLoad ##
  * Placed on any field
  * Field will be saved to the datastore but will be ignored during load operations

## @com.googlecode.objectify.annotation.AlsoLoad ##
  * Placed on a field or the single parameter to a method
  * Requires one value, the name of a property in the datastore to load into the field.
  * Example:  `@AlsoLoad("whatThisFieldUsedToBeCalled")`
  * Causes the field to be loaded from an alternate name in the underlying datastore
  * If placed on the parameter to a method that takes a single parameter, the method will be called with the datastore value
  * Can be used on multiple fields; they will all receive the loaded value.

## @com.googlecode.objectify.annotation.Cache ##
  * Placed on an entity class
  * Stores entity data in a write-through cache for faster read performance
  * Allows you to specify the expiration of entities in the cache

## @com.googlecode.objectify.annotation.Serialize ##
  * Placed on any entity field of Serializable type
  * Causes the object graph at that point to be stored as a serialized Blob.
  * You can optionally configure zipping and compression level.
  * See the [serializing](http://code.google.com/p/objectify-appengine/wiki/Entities#Serializing) documentation.

## @com.googlecode.objectify.annotation.OnLoad ##
  * Placed on any method that takes no parameters.
  * Called after the POJO is populated with data.
  * Can be specified on multiple methods in this class or any base class.
  * Methods are called in declared order, with superclass methods first.
  * See LifecycleCallbacks

## @com.googlecode.objectify.annotation.OnSave ##
  * Placed on any method that takes no parameters.
  * Called before the POJO is written to the datastore Entity.
  * Can be specified on multiple methods in this class or any base class.
  * Methods are called in declared order, with superclass methods first.
  * See LifecycleCallbacks

## @com.googlecode.objectify.annotation.Load ##
  * Placed on entity fields of type `Ref<?>`
  * Causes the referenced entity to be loaded automatically
  * Load groups can be specified to limit when loading occurs
  * See [Relationships](http://code.google.com/p/objectify-appengine/wiki/Entities#Relationships)
